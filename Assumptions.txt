The following are what I took into consideration


- I chose symfony because its a framework that lets me define my direction without much restrictions
- It has cross Site Request Forgery Protection because by default Symfony embeds and validates CSRF token in the forms automatically.

- As for SQL Injection i am not at risk to that because i am not performing any query that requires direct user input, moreover, the doctrine orm being used alongside symfony protect the app from any Injection.


FOR THE CONSOLE SCRIPT
- I had problems with the crumb i could not get it to fetch data from my jenkins instance. Though i think i will 
be aable to figure it out soon.


Thanks
